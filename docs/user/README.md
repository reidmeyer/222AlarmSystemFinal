Alarm System User readme


Setting up the system requires some technical skills. To set it up, read the developer readme in docs/developer/README.md

Once you have the system set up, this readme will lay out the mostly intuitive user interface.



On the Security.html main screen, You can see the alarm status, date/time of last alarm, the power strip status, and some buttons.
You can disable/enable the alarm. The alarm takes about 5-10 seconds to arm, so that you can exit the house.
You can toggle the powerstrip, that way you can have it plugged into whatever fits your needs.
You can go to the pictures/videos which is a link to the apache server.
If you go to the settings page through the link at the top, you can enable/disable the ringer.
The ui also will alert the user when a text is sent.
There also is a scroll box with the log of the times that the alarm has been set off.
